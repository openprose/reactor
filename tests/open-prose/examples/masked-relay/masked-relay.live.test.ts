// The masked-relay LIVE check (OPTIONAL, key-gated): a reliability smoke
// that drives a peer-blind slice of the relay (signal-inbox → signal-ledger →
// scout) with a REAL model at the `asyncMounts` seam (createAgentRender) instead
// of the deterministic fake.
//
// It honors REACTOR_OFFLINE and is gated `{ skip: hasOpenRouterKey() ? false :
// "…" }` exactly like every other live test in the repo: a keyless /
// REACTOR_OFFLINE=1 run reports a PASSING SKIPPED body and never touches the
// network — the offline commit gate is unaffected by this file.
//
// The reliability property (the live half of the tenet): with a real render, a
// cold start renders the gateway and propagates down the relay, and a NO-CHANGE
// re-wake memo-SKIPS the gateway at ZERO model calls (cost scales with surprise,
// even live). The deterministic sibling (masked-relay.test.ts) is the green bar
// that gates the commit; this only kicks the tires with a model when a key is set.
