// The oblique-weave LIVE check (OPTIONAL, key-gated): a reliability smoke
// that drives a masked-viewport slice (a Viewport Policy + two adversarial roles)
// with a REAL model at the `asyncMounts` seam (createAgentRender), instead of the
// deterministic fake.
//
// It honors REACTOR_OFFLINE and is gated `{ skip: hasOpenRouterKey() ? false :
// "…" }` exactly like every other live test in the repo: a keyless /
// REACTOR_OFFLINE=1 run reports a PASSING SKIPPED body and never touches the
// network — the offline commit gate is unaffected by this file.
//
// The reliability property (the live half of the tenet): with a real render, a
// cold start renders the Viewport Policy and propagates to BOTH role lanes, and a
// NO-CHANGE re-wake memo-SKIPS the viewport at ZERO model calls (cost scales with
// surprise, even live). The deterministic sibling (oblique-weave.test.ts) is the
// green bar that gates the commit; this only kicks the tires with a model.
