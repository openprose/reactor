// The basic-unit-suite OPTIONAL key-gated LIVE check: a reliability
// smoke that drives the gateway→summary edge with a REAL model at the
// `asyncMounts` seam (createAgentRender) instead of the deterministic fake.
//
// It honors REACTOR_OFFLINE and is gated `{ skip: hasOpenRouterKey() ? false :
// "…" }` exactly like every other live test in the repo: a keyless /
// REACTOR_OFFLINE=1 run reports a PASSING SKIPPED body and never touches the
// network, so the offline commit gate is unaffected by this file.
//
// The reliability property (the live half of the substrate): with a real render,
// a cold start renders the gateway and propagates to the count summary, and a
// NO-CHANGE re-wake memo-SKIPS the gateway at ZERO model calls: the memo key
// gates render even when the render is a model session. The deterministic sibling
// (basic-unit-suite.test.ts) is the green bar that gates the commit; this only
// kicks the tires with a model when a key is set.
