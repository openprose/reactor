// The tamper-forge LIVE check (OPTIONAL, key-gated): a reliability smoke
// that drives the audit lens (ledger-feed → chain-auditor) with a REAL model at
// the `asyncMounts` seam (createAgentRender) instead of the deterministic fake.
//
// It honors REACTOR_OFFLINE and is gated `{ skip: hasOpenRouterKey() ? false :
// "…" }` exactly like every other live test in the repo: a keyless /
// REACTOR_OFFLINE=1 run reports a PASSING SKIPPED body and never touches the
// network — the offline commit gate is unaffected by this file.
//
// The reliability property (the live half of the tenet): with a real model
// producing the verdict, a cold audit renders BOTH nodes AND its receipt chain
// STILL verifies (a live render does not weaken the chain-verify guarantee), and a
// NO-CHANGE re-audit memo-SKIPS the feed at ZERO model calls (cost scales with
// surprise, even live). The deterministic sibling (tamper-forge.test.ts) is the
// green bar that gates the commit and owns the 3-attack escalation; this only
// kicks the tires with a model when a key is set.
