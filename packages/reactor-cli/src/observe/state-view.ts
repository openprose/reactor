 * The KEYLESS read-only view over a populated state-dir (CLI plan Phase 5 — the

 * N2 OFFLINE BOUNDARY: every adapter opened here is on the SDK's offline root
 * barrel (`@openprose/reactor`): `createFileSystemStorageAdapter`,
 * `createFileSystemReceiptLedger`, `createFileSystemWorldModelStore`,
 * `verifyReceiptChain`. None pull `@openai/agents`/`zod`. The observability
 * commands are model-FREE — they read the durable trail + truth + cached
 * topology and NEVER reach the model surface (no dynamic import of the live
 * adapters happens; the boundary test asserts this).
 *
 * The view is purely read-only: it RE-DERIVES the per-node receipt chains from
 * the persisted trail (architecture.md §8: "the ledger is the source of truth"),
 * re-opens the world-model store on the same directory (so a published face
 * re-reads identically), and re-loads + re-lowers the cached IR via the keyless
 * `loadIR` (whose `compileNode` re-lower is the determinism boundary's run side,
 * not a model call). It writes NOTHING.
