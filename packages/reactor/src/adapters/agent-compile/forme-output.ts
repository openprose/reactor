/**
 * The Forme SESSION's structured output schema + the deterministic lowering of
 * that output into a {@link ReconcilerTopology} (Phase 3a; architecture.md §3.1;
 * forme.md). This is the Determinism boundary in code:
 *
 *   - The SESSION (intelligent, SKILL-loaded) reads the contract set and makes
 *     the ONE judgment call only it can make: the semantic `### Requires` ↔
 *     `### Maintains` match (forme.md step 2; "string-matching would defeat the
 *     point of a smart wiring layer"). It also reports each node's facet
 *     decomposition + declared wake-source. It emits all of this as a STRUCTURED
 *     `finalOutput` (this schema).
 *   - The deterministic `wire(...)` scaffolding (edge resolution given the
 *     matches, fan-in slots, ambiguity/unsatisfied diagnostics, acyclicity DFS)
 *     is Forme's TOOLS/VALIDATORS — it runs HERE, deterministically, over the
 *     session's decisions. The placeholder `exactFacetMatcher` is NOT used; the
 *     matcher is the session's reported match-set.
 *
 * Intelligence is frozen ONCE (the session) into a deterministic artifact (the
 * topology) the dumb reconciler executes — gap-audit "Determinism boundary".
 *
 * `zod` is a dev/optional dep imported for the schema; nothing here runs at
 * import time (the schema is built lazily via {@link formeOutputSchema}), so the
 * offline-build guard holds. The lowering ({@link lowerFormeOutput}) is pure and
 * imports no SDK — it is offline-testable with a literal object.
