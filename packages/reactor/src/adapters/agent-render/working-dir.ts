/**
 * The render's REAL per-node working directory. This is the Codex-style
 * affordance: a render mounts against a real directory on disk, writes real
 * files there with `fs_*` / `shell_exec` / `apply_patch`, and the harness
 * HARVESTS that directory → (compiled, deterministic canonicalizer, at commit) →
 * published truth + FingerprintMap → signed receipt. The harvest reads a
 * directory instead of the store's virtual workspace map.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * SANDBOX LIMITATION — READ BEFORE EXTENDING
 * ===========================================================================
 * This is a SCOPED working directory with PATH-ESCAPE GUARDS only. It is NOT an
 * OS sandbox. The `fs_*` tools reject any path that resolves outside the root,
 * and `shell_exec` runs with `cwd` set to the root — but a shell command can
 * still `cd /`, read/write anywhere the process user can, and reach the network.
 * The turn/cost backstop is the only other bound.
 *
 *   - This is acceptable for TRUSTED, self-authored `.prose` projects and the
 *     repo's own live tests.
 *   - It is NOT safe for UNTRUSTED contract sets executing arbitrary shell. Do
 *     NOT claim isolation we do not have.
 *   - The OS sandbox (seatbelt on macOS / landlock on Linux, or the SDK's
 *     Docker/Unix-local sandbox infra, or delegating to the real Codex via
 *     `codexTool()`) is deferred, to be gated when an untrusted-execution use
 *     case is real. Until then, callers MUST treat the contract set as trusted.
 *
 * Determinism boundary: the directory harvest below is a PLAIN, NON-MODEL
 * `node:fs` walk. No model call enters it. The canonicalizer the harness applies
 * on commit stays the deterministic op it always was; this module only changes
 * WHERE the pre-commit files come from (a real dir), not how they are
 * fingerprinted.
 *
 * Offline-build guard: this module imports ONLY `node:*` + the world-model
 * canonical path helpers. It does NOT import `@openai/agents` or `zod`, so it is
 * safe for the adapter's keyless construction path (the working dir is prepared
 * before any model call).
