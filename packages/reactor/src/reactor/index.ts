// The dumb reconciler — the run-phase spine of @openprose/reactor.
//
// This module is the GUT+REBUILD of the retired judge/policy spine
// (delta.md §A0/§A3.1). There is NO judge, NO policy artifact, NO predicate
// backstop, NO rollback machinery here. The skip decision *is* the reconciler
// comparing fingerprints (delta.md §A0.1: "The skip decision is the reconciler
// comparing fingerprints").
//
// The reconciler's whole job (architecture.md §4.1):
//   1. MEMO/SKIP   — key = (contract_fingerprint, input_fingerprints), nothing
//                    else. If neither half moved since the node's last receipt,
//                    write a cheap `skipped` receipt and spawn nothing.
//                    "Cost scales with surprise, not the clock."
//   2. SCHEDULE    — single-flight per node; wakes arriving mid-render mark the
//                    node dirty and collapse into ONE follow-up render against
//                    the freshly-moved inputs (single-flight + coalescing,
//                    world-model.md §8).
//   3. COMMIT      — a `rendered` render persists its published world-model,
//                    signs a receipt, and appends it to the node-scoped ledger.
//   4. PROPAGATE   — on a `rendered` receipt whose fingerprint moved, wake the
//                    downstreams subscribed to the moved facet(s), resolved by
//                    reading the topology world-model's edges (architecture.md
//                    §6.3). Only `rendered`-with-a-moved-fingerprint propagates;
//                    `skipped`/`failed` do not.
//
