// Forme — the DAG-level wiring as an SDK runtime artifact.
//
// Forme is the compile-phase render that "draws the DAG from contracts"
// (architecture.md §3.1): it reads all declared contracts, semantically matches
// `Requires.<facet> ↔ Maintains.<facet>` across mounted responsibilities, draws
// the subscription edges, registers external-driven entry points, and enforces
// acyclicity as a postcondition on its own `### Maintains` (plan.md §5).
//
// Its output is the TOPOLOGY WORLD-MODEL (architecture.md §6.3) — a maintained
// truth like any other: `nodes` / `edges` / `entry_points` / `acyclic`. The
// reconciler reads `edges` to resolve propagation targets (architecture.md
// §4.1). This module is the SDK runtime; the SKILL `forme.md` doc owns the
// natural-language compile contract.
//
// Two load-bearing model decisions, taken straight from the spec:
//
//   1. NODE-NESS IS ADDITIVE — it comes from MOUNTING, not statefulness
//      (plan.md §2). A `RenderContract` is just a declaration + render. Mounting
//      ADDS identity + a persisted world-model + resolved subscriptions, turning
//      it into a `MountedNode`. The render atom runs standalone (unmounted) or
//      mounted; mounting never rewrites the contract, it only wraps it.
//
//   2. FORME INFERS THE WIRING; THE AUTHOR DECLARES THE WAKE-SOURCE
//      (plan.md §5). Forme only *infers* the input-driven edges (by matching
//      facet contracts); it *reads* declared `### Continuity` to register entry
//      points. It never guesses a cadence or a trigger.
//
// The semantic Requires↔Maintains match is the one intelligent step
// (architecture.md §3.1: "string-matching would defeat the point of a smart
// layer"). In this SDK runtime the matcher is an INJECTED pure function
// (`FacetMatcher`) — the compile-phase intelligence lives behind the injection
// boundary (architecture.md §5.3), while the deterministic scaffolding (slot
// assignment, conflict diagnostics, entry-point registration, acyclicity) lives
// here. A default exact-name matcher is provided for tests and the degenerate
// already-canonicalized case.
