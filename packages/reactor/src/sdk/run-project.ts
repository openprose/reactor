/**
 * The in-package end-to-end RUNNER (PHASE5 §4; intelligent-react #13). The thin
 * deterministic seam that takes a directory of `.prose.md` contracts ALL THE WAY
 * to a booted, reconciling reactor — WITHOUT any hand-authored topology and
 * WITHOUT any new `.prose` parser. Two phases, mirroring the architecture's
 * determinism boundary:
 *
 *   1. {@link compileProject} — the COMPILE phase as SESSIONS. `loadContractSet`
 *      (trivial file-loading) → `compileForme` (the topology session) → per node
 *      `compileCanonicalizer` + `compilePostcondition` (the materiality + commit-
 *      gate sessions). Returns the mountable `ReconcilerTopology` + the per-node
 *      compiled canonicalizers/validators. Every model call is a session; pass a
 *      FAKE provider via `options` for an offline (keyless) compile.
 *
 *   2. {@link runProject} — the RUN phase, dumb. Builds the live agent-render over
 *      the SAME world-model store `createReactor` commits to, mounts each node's
 *      render with the canonicalizer its canonicalizer-SESSION emitted
 *      (`compiledStoreCanonicalizer` — GOTCHA 1: NOT `atomicCanonicalizer`, or a
 *      producer's moved facet never propagates), assembles the reactor, and runs
 *      the BOOT cold-miss sweep (`reactor.bootAsync()` — GOTCHA 2: boot is the
 *      honest first render of a pure source; only sources are seeded, input-driven
 *      nodes wake via propagation).
 *
 * Determinism boundary (THREE PRINCIPLES): the SESSIONS produce artifacts
 * (topology + canonicalizers); the dumb run phase EXECUTES them. The canonicalizer
 * is a deterministic run-time reduction, never a model call. The render WRITES
 * files to its workspace; the harness promotes-and-fingerprints — file contents
 * never ride `finalOutput`.
 *
 * Offline-build guard: this module DEEP-IMPORTS the live adapters (agent-render /
 * agent-compile) — both `@openai/agents`+`zod` (dev/optional) consumers. It is
 * therefore intentionally NOT re-exported from the offline barrels
 * (`src/sdk/index.ts`, `src/adapters/index.ts`); a consumer of the offline core
 * never reaches it, and a keyless build never constructs a provider (the
 * agent-render factory builds its provider lazily on first render).
