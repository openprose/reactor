// The typed `Reactor` running handle — the ONE object a driver holds.
//
// `mountDag` (mounted-dag.ts) wires the dumb reconciler over a world-model store
// + a receipt ledger and exposes SIX co-equal drive verbs (sync `ingest`/`tick`/
// `drain` + their `*Async` siblings) plus the raw `reconciler` primitive. That
// shape is honest but low-altitude: a consumer wanting "deliver an input, settle
// to a fixpoint, read the ledger/store" had to reach through `.dag` and cast to
// the un-surfaced `store`/`ledger` accessors (the reference CLI's ~11
// `as unknown as { store }` / `(reactor as { dag }).dag` casts).
//
// THIS module hoists the run-phase surface onto ONE typed `Reactor` interface:
//
//   - drive verbs are ASYNC-BY-DEFAULT (the live path — a real render IS one
//     bounded LLM session = one `await`). A sync render is trivially an
//     already-resolved promise (mounted-dag.ts:90-98), so the async verbs subsume
//     the sync ones losslessly.
//   - the SYNC verbs (the deterministic fake-render / test path) are preserved
//     verbatim behind `handle.sync` — never amputated, just demoted from co-equal
//     to a named door.
//   - observe accessors (`ledger` / `store` / `clock` / `topology`) are
//     FIRST-CLASS — no casts.
//   - `scheduler(readFreshness)` wires the self-driven continuity cadence off the
//     handle (it already holds the dag + topology the scheduler needs).
//
// The full reconciler primitive (`ReconcilerHandle`) is NOT on this handle — it
// is engine-room altitude and stays reachable via `@openprose/reactor/internals`
// (same home as the rest of the reconciler-construction spine). A power user
// re-hosting the loop reaches it there.
//
// Source of truth: architecture.md §4.1 (reconciler), §4.2 (continuity), §5.1
// (ledger), §5.2 (world-model store), §8 (boot); the API ideal-surface plan §3.5
// (one typed handle; the casts vanish) + §3.3 (the facade returns this handle).
