// continuity-scheduler.ts — the clock-driven self-driven cadence loop
// (gap-audit 00-INVENTORY #11; build plan Phase 4a).
//
// The `forecast/` module (evaluateContinuityTick + createSelfRecheckReceipt)
// holds the self-driven `### Continuity` math — "which facets have lapsed as of
// `as_of`, what is the soonest remaining `valid_until`, and the SYNTHETIC
// self-receipt that records the lapse". This module is the DRIVER that turns
// that math into an end-to-end loop: it arms a timer off `next_self_recheck`,
// manufactures the tick, and (on a lapse) appends the synthetic self-receipt and
// drains propagation — the forecast path `dag.tick` deliberately bypasses. The
// CLI `serve` command now wires it live: `createAsyncContinuityScheduler` is
// armed once at boot and polled on a flat `--poll-interval` cadence, so U09
// (self-driven recheck on a `valid_until` lapse) is driveable end-to-end.
//
// THE MECHANISM (world-model.md §5/§6; forecast/index.ts header). A self-driven
// node's continuity clock emits a SYNTHETIC SELF-RECEIPT — a tick whose
// `wake.source === "self"`. The tick is NOT a model render: a lapsed `valid_until`
// is a DETERMINISTIC, replayable move (`applyFreshnessMove`), so the forecast math
// produces a complete receipt with the lapsed facet's fingerprint MOVED, costing
// zero tokens (`surprise_cause: "self"`). "Time becoming material" is just another
// change that propagates as surprise — there is no special clock path in the
// reconciler. So the scheduler:
//   1. arms each self-driven node's soonest `next_self_recheck` off its freshness;
//   2. when the clock reaches it, evaluates the tick; on a lapse it APPENDS the
//      synthetic self-receipt to the ledger (the tick IS the receipt — "every wake
//      is a receipt") and PROPAGATES the moved facet to downstream subscribers
//      (a normal reconciler drain of the propagation targets); then RE-ARMS.
//
// Why the synthetic receipt and not `dag.tick` (a self WAKE through the
// reconciler)? Because the memo key is `(contract_fingerprint, input_fingerprints)`
// — a self wake on a SOURCE node with unchanged inputs MEMO-SKIPS (architecture.md
// §6.1; the run-phase carry-over). The honest way a freshness lapse re-renders is
// the freshness BRIDGE: the lapse moves the facet fingerprint directly, which the
// synthetic receipt records, which then moves downstream input-fingerprints and
// wakes those subscribers through the ordinary memo path. The determinism boundary
// holds: fingerprinting the lapse is a non-model op (world-model.md §6).
//
// Source of truth:
//   - architecture.md §4.2 (L181–L191): the self-driven continuity beat.
//   - world-model.md §5 (L234–L236): every wake is a receipt; self-driven = the
//     node's continuity clock emitting a synthetic self-receipt.
//   - world-model.md §6 (L267–L283): freshness STATE (`valid_until`) is data;
//     freshness POLICY (the recheck cadence) reads the soonest `valid_until`.
//   - forecast/index.ts: `evaluateContinuityTick` (the sleep/fire + `next_self_recheck`
//     math + the synthetic-receipt manufacture this loop finally calls).

 * Read a self-driven node's current freshness state as a {@link ContinuitySchedule}.

 * Freshness *state* (`valid_until` per facet) is DATA carried in the node's
 * published world-model (world-model.md §6); how a given render encodes it there
 * is a render/contract concern, NOT a fixed substrate schema. So the scheduler
 * takes the freshness state by INJECTION — a pure function the caller supplies
 * that projects the node's current truth + last receipt (`prev`,
 * `input_fingerprints`, per-facet fingerprints) into the forecast schedule.
 * Returns `null` for a node with no freshness policy (a timeless node never arms a
 * recheck) or one that has not rendered yet.
 *
 * This keeps the scheduler decoupled from any particular world-model encoding
 * (the build-the-destination-directly rule): a fake-render test supplies a tiny
 * projector over its JSON truth + ledger; a live deployment supplies the projector
 * the canonicalizer-compile session would emit alongside the facet field-paths.
